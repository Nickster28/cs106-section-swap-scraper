# cs106-section-swap-scraper
A scraper for the Stanford CS198 section rosters site to determine which sections have >= 2 open slots.

To run, follow the steps below:

1) Go to https://cs198.stanford.edu/cs198/auth/section/ManageSections.aspx and authenticate
2) View the page source, and copy it into the `webpage.html` file in this project, overwriting the existing contents.
3) Run `node index.js`.  The script will parse the webpage contents and output an autogenerated email to `email.txt` containing a list of all section times with >=2 open spaces.
